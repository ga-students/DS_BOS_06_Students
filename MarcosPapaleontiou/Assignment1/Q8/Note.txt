I added Miguel Cabrera's Batting stats as well as the Triple Crown award he got in 2012. I'm sure there are more
tables that need to be updated but since I'm not familiar with baseball at all I'll stick to the two tables I've updated.
I believe I have a good grasp of how the INSERT clause/statement works.
